================================================================================

================================================================================
                        BATTLE OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Combat in Mind Architect represents a philosophical debate or internal
struggle against cognitive bias. You're not fighting with swords—you're
constructing arguments.

TERMINOLOGY:
- PERSUASION: Your "damage" - how convincing your argument is
- COHERENCE: Your "health" - the logical consistency of your worldview
- ENTRENCHMENT: Enemy "health" - how embedded the bias is
- RESISTANCE: Enemy "armor" - how defended against logic


================================================================================
                         TURN STRUCTURE
================================================================================

YOUR TURN
─────────
1. DRAW PHASE
   - Draw 5 cards (can be modified by relics)
   - Flaws are drawn like normal cards
   - "Innate" cards always appear

2. PLANNING PHASE
   - View hand, enemy intent, board state
   - No time limit
   - Can view discard pile, deck count

3. PLAY PHASE
   - Spend Thought Points (TP) to play cards
   - Default: 3 TP per turn
   - Cards resolve in order played
   - Can end turn early

4. RESOLUTION PHASE
   - All played cards form your "Argument"
   - Damage is calculated (see below)
   - Effects trigger in order
   - Cards go to discard pile

5. END PHASE
   - Hand discards (unless "Retain")
   - End-of-turn effects trigger
   - Enemy intent updates

ENEMY TURN
──────────
1. INTENT PHASE
   - Enemy reveals next action (shown during your turn)
   - You always know what's coming

2. ACTION PHASE
   - Enemy performs their action
   - Attack, defend, special ability, or buff

3. EFFECT PHASE
   - Any ongoing effects tick
   - Status conditions apply/expire


================================================================================
                      DAMAGE CALCULATION
================================================================================

Your argument's PERSUASION (damage) is calculated as follows:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                             │
│   PERSUASION = (Total Weight) × (Combined Multiplier) × (Bonuses)           │
│                                                                             │
│   Where:                                                                    │
│   • Total Weight = Sum of all Evidence card weights                         │
│   • Combined Multiplier = Product of all Logic card multipliers             │
│   • Bonuses = Relic effects, temporary buffs, special conditions            │
│                                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

EXAMPLE CALCULATION:

Cards Played:
1. Observation (Weight: 3)
2. Statistics (Weight: 5)
3. Modus Ponens (Multiplier: 1.5x)
4. Pattern Matching (Multiplier: 1.3x)
5. Therefore (+2 weight as finisher)

Calculation:
- Total Weight = 3 + 5 + 2 (Therefore) = 10
- Combined Multiplier = 1.5 × 1.3 = 1.95
- Persuasion = 10 × 1.95 = 19.5 → 20 (rounded)

WITH RELIC "Philosopher's Stone" (+0.5x to Logic):
- Adjusted Multipliers = 2.0 × 1.8 = 3.6
- Persuasion = 10 × 3.6 = 36


================================================================================
                     ARGUMENT CHAIN MECHANICS
================================================================================

Cards played in sequence form an "Argument Chain."
Chains provide bonus damage based on length and coherence.

CHAIN LENGTH BONUS:
- 1-2 cards: No bonus
- 3 cards: +10% damage
- 4 cards: +25% damage
- 5 cards: +50% damage
- 6+ cards: +75% damage (maximum)

CHAIN COHERENCE:
Your chain must not contain contradictions. Playing cards that
logically oppose each other breaks coherence.

OPPOSING PAIRS (Cannot coexist without penalty):
- Absolute Truth + Relativism
- Determinism + Free Will (unless using Synthesis)
- Rationalism + Pure Empiricism
- Certainty + Radical Skepticism

COHERENCE BREAK PENALTY:
- Playing contradicting cards: -5 Coherence
- Coherence break interrupts chain: No chain bonus
- Some cards (Dialectic, Aufhebung) prevent penalty


================================================================================
                       COHERENCE SYSTEM
================================================================================

COHERENCE is your philosophical health.

STARTING COHERENCE: 50 (can be modified)
MAXIMUM COHERENCE: 75
LOSING CONDITION: Coherence reaches 0

GAINING COHERENCE:
- Rest sites: +10 Coherence
- Some relics: +1 per battle won
- Rare cards: Conditional coherence gain
- "Clarity" moments in narrative

LOSING COHERENCE:
- Enemy attacks: Variable damage
- Playing contradicting cards: -5 each
- Flaw card effects: Variable
- Some powerful cards cost Coherence

COHERENCE THRESHOLDS:
- 50+: Full effectiveness
- 30-49: Warning state (visual cue)
- 15-29: Critical (some cards disabled)
- 1-14: Desperate (simplified UI, tense music)
- 0: Defeat - "Lost in Confusion"


================================================================================
                    ENEMY ENTRENCHMENT & RESISTANCE
================================================================================

ENTRENCHMENT (Enemy HP)
───────────────────────
How deeply the bias is embedded in thinking.
Reduced by your Persuasion damage.

RESISTANCE (Enemy Armor)
────────────────────────
Some biases resist certain argument types.
Resistance reduces incoming damage of that type.

RESISTANCE TYPES:
- Evidence Resistance: Reduces damage from Evidence cards
- Logic Resistance: Reduces multiplier effectiveness
- Emotional Resistance: Immune to pathos-based effects
- Authority Resistance: Expert Opinion cards less effective

Example:
- Confirmation Bias has Evidence Resistance: 3
- Your argument deals 20 Persuasion
- 15 of that was from Evidence weight
- Reduced: 20 - 3 = 17 actual damage


================================================================================
                      ENEMY INTENT SYSTEM
================================================================================

Enemies telegraph their next action with visual indicators.

INTENT TYPES:

⚔️ ATTACK: Will deal Coherence damage
   - Number shown = damage amount
   - Color indicates type (red = direct, purple = effect)

🛡️ DEFEND: Will gain Resistance or immunity
   - Shield icon = gaining resistance
   - Specific icon = type of defense

💫 BUFF: Will strengthen itself
   - Up arrow = power increase
   - Clock = lasting effect

🌀 SPECIAL: Unique ability
   - Each bias has signature moves
   - Learn patterns through play

💭 DEBUFF: Will add Flaw to your deck
   - Skull icon = incoming Flaw
   - Type indicated by color


================================================================================
                        SPECIAL MECHANICS
================================================================================

SYNTHESIS MECHANIC
──────────────────
When you play Thesis on a card, then Antithesis on an opposing card,
they combine into a Synthesis.

Process:
1. Play "Thesis" on Card A (e.g., "Free Will")
2. Play Card A
3. Play "Antithesis"
4. Play Card B that opposes A (e.g., "Determinism")
5. SYNTHESIS triggers:
   - Damage: 3.0x multiplier applied
   - New Card: "Compatibilism" added to deck
   - No Coherence loss from contradiction

Synthesis cards are powerful and represent genuine philosophical progress.

STEELMANNING MECHANIC
─────────────────────
Using the "Steelman" card copies the enemy's strongest argument.

Process:
1. Play "Steelman" (costs 2 TP)
2. Copy appears in your hand
3. If you win using that card: 2x rewards

This teaches the real skill of understanding opposing viewpoints.

SOCRATIC CHAIN
──────────────
Playing multiple "Why?" cards in sequence creates escalating multipliers.

Chain effect:
- 1st Why: 1.5x
- 2nd Why: 2.0x
- 3rd Why: 2.5x
- 4th Why: 3.0x
- 5th Why: 3.5x + "Five Whys" achievement

REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM
────────────────────
If the enemy has a Flaw or contradiction, Reductio deals massive damage.

Condition: Enemy must have:
- A Flaw card used against you
- An internal contradiction (rare, elite enemies)
- A logically impossible position

Damage: 2.5x multiplier + enemy loses next turn


================================================================================
                        DAMAGE TYPES
================================================================================

There are different "flavors" of Persuasion:

LOGOS (Logical)
───────────────
- Primary damage type
- Comes from Evidence + Logic combinations
- Resisted by Logic Resistance
- Effective against: Appeal to Emotion, Red Herring

ETHOS (Credibility)
───────────────────
- From Authority and Expertise cards
- Reduced by Authority Resistance
- Effective against: Ad Hominem, Genetic Fallacy

PATHOS (Emotional)
──────────────────
- From Narrative and Story cards
- Reduced by Emotional Resistance
- Effective against: Cold Logic bias, Vulcan fallacy

KAIROS (Timing)
───────────────
- Bonus damage for perfect timing
- Playing exactly what the situation needs
- Cannot be resisted
- Rare, triggered by specific conditions


================================================================================
                     VICTORY & DEFEAT CONDITIONS
================================================================================

VICTORY:
- Reduce enemy Entrenchment to 0
- Enemy admits defeat (dialogue)
- Rewards screen appears

DEFEAT:
- Coherence reduced to 0
- "Lost in Confusion" screen
- Run ends (unless revive relic)

SPECIAL VICTORIES:
- "Perfect Logic": Win without Coherence loss (+bonus)
- "Steelman Victory": Win using enemy's own logic (+2x rewards)
- "Socratic Victory": Win using only questions (+achievement)


================================================================================
                         DIFFICULTY SCALING
