                            GAME VISION
================================================================================

HIGH CONCEPT
------------
Mind Architect is a roguelike deckbuilder where you construct arguments from
mental models, logical structures, and evidence to defeat cognitive biases.
Your deck IS your mind. Your damage IS persuasion. Your health IS coherence.

UNIQUE SELLING POINTS
---------------------
1. Actually teaches critical thinking through gameplay
2. Arguments must be internally consistent (coherence mechanic)
3. Synthesis system rewards understanding opposing views
4. Enemies are real cognitive biases with accurate behaviors
5. Accessible browser-based play on VeryGoodMelon.fun

TARGET AUDIENCE
---------------
Primary: Adults 18-45 interested in:
- Strategy/deckbuilder games (Slay the Spire, Balatro, Inscryption fans)
- Philosophy and critical thinking
- Self-improvement through games

Secondary:
- Educators looking for teaching tools
- Casual players who enjoy puzzle games
- Philosophy students and enthusiasts


================================================================================
                          DESIGN PILLARS
================================================================================

PILLAR 1: THINK TO WIN
----------------------
Every mechanic reinforces critical thinking skills:
- Card selection = choosing reasoning strategies
- Damage calculation = understanding argument strength
- Enemy weaknesses = recognizing bias vulnerabilities
- Coherence system = maintaining logical consistency

Players should feel SMARTER after playing.

PILLAR 2: ELEGANT COMPLEXITY
----------------------------
Simple rules, emergent depth:
- Core mechanics learnable in 5 minutes
- Mastery requires understanding philosophy
- Every card interaction makes intuitive sense
- No arbitrary rules - everything connects to real logic

PILLAR 3: MEANINGFUL CHOICES
----------------------------
Every decision matters:
- Card selection affects future options
- Path choices change difficulty
- Argument chains require planning
- Risk/reward in coherence damage

No "always correct" plays - context determines strategy.

PILLAR 4: CALM INTENSITY
------------------------
Engaging without anxiety:
- Turn-based (no time pressure)
- Clear information (no hidden RNG)
- Undo last action (prevent misclicks)
- Auto-save (no loss of progress)
- Meditative aesthetic (thinking space)


================================================================================
                           CORE LOOP
================================================================================

MICRO LOOP (Single Turn)
------------------------
1. VIEW: See your hand, enemy state, coherence
2. THINK: Plan your argument chain
3. PLAY: Select and combine cards
4. RESOLVE: Watch damage/effects apply
5. DRAW: Replenish hand for next turn

MESO LOOP (Single Battle)
-------------------------
1. ASSESS: Identify bias type and weakness
2. BUILD: Construct argument strategy
3. EXECUTE: Play cards over multiple turns
4. ADAPT: Respond to enemy actions
5. CONCLUDE: Defeat bias or lose coherence

MACRO LOOP (Single Run)
-----------------------
1. START: Choose school of thought, begin run
2. NAVIGATE: Select path through map
3. BATTLE: Face biases and collect cards
4. UPGRADE: Improve deck at rest sites
5. BOSS: Face the Big Question
6. PROGRESS: Advance to next floor or end

META LOOP (Across Runs)
-----------------------
1. ATTEMPT: Complete or fail a run
2. UNLOCK: Gain new cards, relics, schools
3. LEARN: Internalize strategies and logic
4. RETRY: Apply knowledge to new run


================================================================================
                        MOMENT-TO-MOMENT FEEL
================================================================================

We want players to feel:

DURING CARD SELECTION:
"This evidence plus this logic should work... but wait, if I play
Observation first, then Pattern Recognition multiplies it... YES."

DURING DAMAGE CALCULATION:
"2 weight x 1.5 multiplier x 1.5 from my relic = 4.5, rounded to 5...
I love seeing these numbers stack!"

DURING COHERENCE MANAGEMENT:
"I have 'Absolute Truth' in my argument, but 'Skepticism' would deal
massive damage here... is -3 coherence worth the 12 persuasion?"

DURING BOSS FIGHTS:
"The Trolley Problem... I need Ethical Framework + Consequences...
I have Utilitarianism but I traded away Deontology... damn, I need
to build around what I have."

AFTER WINNING A RUN:
"I actually understand inductive reasoning better now. And I can
recognize when I'm using confirmation bias in real life."


================================================================================
                         SUCCESS METRICS
================================================================================

DESIGN GOALS (How we measure success)
-------------------------------------
1. COMPLETION RATE: 20-30% of runs should end in victory
2. SESSION LENGTH: Average 30-45 minutes per run
3. REPLAY VALUE: Players attempt 5+ runs before boredom
4. LEARNING TRANSFER: Players report thinking differently in real life
5. ACCESSIBILITY: Playable with keyboard only, screen reader support

ANTI-GOALS (What we're NOT trying to do)
----------------------------------------
1. NOT maximizing time spent (no addiction loops)
2. NOT creating frustrating difficulty spikes
3. NOT hiding information (no unfair surprises)
4. NOT requiring philosophy knowledge to start
5. NOT punishing experimentation

                         REFERENCE GAMES
================================================================================

SLAY THE SPIRE - What we're borrowing:
- Deckbuilding during run
- Path selection on map
- Relic system
- Three-floor structure
- Card upgrade system

BALATRO - What we're borrowing:
- Joker-style passive modifiers
- Multiplication-based scoring
- Visual satisfaction of big numbers
- "Poker hand" = "Argument chain" parallel

INSCRYPTION - What we're borrowing:
- Darker philosophical undertones
- Meta-narrative elements
- Sacrifice/cost mechanics
- Memorable boss encounters

BABA IS YOU - What we're borrowing:
- Rules as manipulable objects
- "Aha!" moments from logic
- Minimalist aesthetic
- Puzzle-like encounters


================================================================================
                      PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

The game is built on real epistemology:

EVIDENCE HIERARCHY (reflected in card weights):
1. Axiom (self-evident) - highest weight
2. Empirical (tested) - high weight
3. Statistical (data) - medium weight
4. Testimonial (reported) - low weight
5. Anecdotal (singular) - lowest weight

LOGICAL VALIDITY (reflected in multipliers):
- Deductive (certain if premises true) - reliable multiplier
- Inductive (probable) - stacking multiplier
- Abductive (best explanation) - high risk/reward

COHERENTISM VS FOUNDATIONALISM:
- Coherence health represents coherentist epistemology
- Some relics enable foundationalist play (Axiom immunity)

DIALECTICAL METHOD:
- Thesis + Antithesis = Synthesis is a core mechanic
- Encourages collecting opposing views
