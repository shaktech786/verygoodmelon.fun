                       QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

ELEVATOR PITCH:
"Slay the Spire meets philosophy class."

CORE HOOK:
Your deck is your mind. Your damage is persuasion.
Your health is coherence. Your enemies are biases.

TARGET FEELINGS:
- "I'm getting smarter at this"
- "Oh, THAT'S what that bias does"
- "This argument is so satisfying"
- "I actually think differently now"

KEY DIFFERENTIATORS:
1. Actually teaches critical thinking
2. Coherence system prevents contradiction
3. Synthesis rewards understanding opposing views
4. Real philosophy, not just fantasy logic
5. Calming aesthetic despite depth


================================================================================
                      DESIGN PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

THINK TO WIN
- Mechanics reinforce real reasoning skills
- Players learn while having fun
- No arbitrary rules—everything connects to logic

ELEGANT COMPLEXITY
- Simple core, emergent depth
- 5-minute learn, lifetime mastery
- Intuitive card interactions

MEANINGFUL CHOICES
- No "always correct" plays
- Context determines strategy
- Risk/reward in coherence system

CALM INTENSITY
- Turn-based (no time pressure)
- Clear information (no hidden RNG)
- Undo available
- Meditative aesthetic


================================================================================
                       UNIQUE MECHANICS
================================================================================

COHERENCE SYSTEM:
Your arguments must be internally consistent. Playing contradicting cards
damages YOUR coherence (health). Forces players to build focused decks.

SYNTHESIS:
Thesis + Antithesis = Synthesis. Playing opposing ideas together
(with the right cards) creates powerful new concepts and cards.

STEELMANNING:
Copy the enemy's best argument. Using it against them gives bonus rewards.
Teaches the real skill of understanding opposing viewpoints.

SOCRATIC CHAINS:
Multiple "Why?" cards in sequence create escalating multipliers.
The Five Whys technique becomes a literal game mechanic.

                       WHY BUILD THIS
================================================================================

FITS VERYGOODMELON.FUN PERFECTLY:
✓ Philosophical depth
✓ Unique concept (not a clone)
✓ Reduces anxiety (turn-based, calming)
✓ Teaches real skills
✓ Browser-based, accessible

MARKET OPPORTUNITY:
- Deckbuilder genre is popular (Slay the Spire, Balatro)
- No major philosophy-themed competitor
- Educational games market growing
- Accessible web-based delivery

PERSONAL VALUE:
- Would play this ourselves
- Teaches things we care about
- Pride in building something meaningful


================================================================================
                         NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IF PROCEEDING TO DEVELOPMENT:

1. PROTOTYPE (1 week)
   - Build basic card playing
   - Single enemy encounter
   - Validate core loop is fun

2. PLAYTEST
   - Get feedback on prototype
   - Iterate on damage feel
   - Test coherence system

3. PRODUCTION
   - Follow phased implementation plan
   - Regular playtesting
   - Iterate on balance

4. LAUNCH
   - Soft launch with core content
   - Gather feedback
   - Expand content post-launch
