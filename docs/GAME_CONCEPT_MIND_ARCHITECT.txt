                            MIND ARCHITECT
           A Critical Thinking Roguelike Deckbuilder
================================================================================

ELEVATOR PITCH
--------------
"Slay the Spire meets philosophy class. Build decks of mental models, logical
structures, and reasoning patterns to defeat cognitive biases and construct
increasingly powerful arguments. Your 'damage' is persuasion. Your health is
coherence. When you 'think big enough,' you win."


CORE CONCEPT
------------
You are a mind awakening in the Abstract Realm - a space between thoughts where
ideas take physical form. To escape and achieve enlightenment, you must:

1. Collect REASONING CARDS (mental models, logic patterns, evidence types)
2. Battle COGNITIVE BIASES (enemies that warp your thinking)
3. Build increasingly complex ARGUMENTS (combos that deal persuasion damage)
4. Maintain your COHERENCE (health - contradictions damage you)
5. Reach the EPIPHANY (final boss: the Ultimate Question you must answer)


THE BALATRO INSPIRATION: SYNERGY & MULTIPLICATION
-------------------------------------------------
Like Balatro's jokers and hand scoring, Mind Architect uses:

THOUGHT MULTIPLIERS:
- Base reasoning cards have a "weight" (like chips)
- Combining them creates "strength" (like multiplier)
- Certain combos trigger bonus effects

Example:
- "Observation" card: 2 weight
- "Pattern Recognition" card: 1.5x multiplier
- Together: 2 x 1.5 = 3 persuasion damage
- Add "First Principles": 2 x 1.5 x 2 = 6 persuasion damage

PHILOSOPHICAL JOKERS (passive bonuses):
- "Occam's Razor": Simpler arguments deal +50% damage
- "Steel Man": Using opponent's best version gives 2x
- "Socratic Method": Questions count as 2 cards
- "Dialectic": Thesis + Antithesis = Synthesis (triple combo)


CARD TYPES (THE DECK)
---------------------

1. EVIDENCE CARDS (Base damage)
   - Observation (1 weight) - raw sensory data
   - Testimony (2 weight) - what others have said
   - Statistics (3 weight) - numbers and data
   - Experiment (4 weight) - tested results
   - Axiom (5 weight) - self-evident truths

2. LOGIC CARDS (Multipliers)
   - Deduction (1.5x) - from general to specific
   - Induction (1.3x, can stack) - from specific to general
   - Abduction (2x, risky) - best explanation
   - Analogy (1.8x) - similar patterns
   - Syllogism (2.5x, requires 2 premises)

3. FRAMEWORK CARDS (Structural bonuses)
   - If-Then (chains two cards)
   - And (combines two arguments)
   - Or (choose best outcome)
   - Not (negates bias effects)
   - Therefore (finishes argument, bonus damage)

4. META CARDS (Special abilities)
   - Steelman (copy enemy's best card)
   - Devil's Advocate (flip a card's effect)
   - Reductio (if enemy has contradiction, massive damage)
   - Thought Experiment (peek at outcomes)
   - Socratic Question (force enemy to reveal card)


ENEMIES: COGNITIVE BIASES
-------------------------

Each bias has a unique attack pattern and weakness:

- CONFIRMATION BIAS (HP: 20)
  - Only takes damage from evidence that contradicts its belief
  - Attack: Forces you to discard contradicting cards
  - Weakness: Diverse evidence decks

- SUNK COST (HP: 25)
  - Gets stronger the longer the fight goes
  - Attack: Locks one of your cards each turn
  - Weakness: Quick, decisive arguments

- SURVIVORSHIP BIAS (HP: 18)
  - Invisible HP bar, can't see true health
  - Attack: Hides your weaker cards
  - Weakness: Statistics cards reveal truth

- DUNNING-KRUGER (HP: 15, thinks it's 50)
  - Overconfident, leaves openings
  - Attack: Boosts your weak cards (trap!)
  - Weakness: Humility cards counter

- APPEAL TO AUTHORITY (HP: 30)
  - Immune to Testimony cards
  - Attack: Your expert cards help it
  - Weakness: First principles, direct evidence

- STRAWMAN (HP: 10, regenerates)
  - Easy to "defeat" but always comes back distorted
  - Attack: Distorts your last argument
  - Weakness: Precise, steelmanned arguments


BOSS FIGHTS: THE BIG QUESTIONS
------------------------------

Each "floor" ends with a philosophical boss:

FLOOR 1: The Problem of Induction
- "Just because the sun rose yesterday, why will it rise tomorrow?"
- Requires: Pattern + Probability + Pragmatic reasoning

FLOOR 2: The Trolley Problem
- "What is the right action when all choices harm someone?"
- Requires: Ethical framework + Consequences + Intention

FLOOR 3: The Ship of Theseus
- "If every part is replaced, is it still the same thing?"
- Requires: Identity + Change + Continuity arguments

FINAL BOSS: The Meaning of Life
- "Why does anything matter?"
- Requires: Complete philosophical system you've built
- Uses ALL your cards, tests every synergy


PROGRESSION SYSTEM
------------------

RUN STRUCTURE:
- 3 floors, 10-15 encounters each
- Choose paths: Easy bias, hard bias, mystery, rest, shop
- Collect new cards, upgrade existing ones
- Find relics (passive buffs)

UPGRADES:
- Cards can be "refined" (increase weight/multiplier)
- Cards can be "specialized" (add conditions for bonus)
- Cards can be "combined" (merge two into one powerful card)

RELICS (Joker-like passives):
- "The Philosopher's Stone": All logic cards +0.5x
- "Descartes' Demon": Once per fight, doubt everything (reset)
- "Wittgenstein's Ladder": Discard after use for +1 card draw
- "Russell's Paradox": Sets that contain themselves explode
- "Hume's Fork": Evidence cards sort into two piles


META-PROGRESSION (Roguelite elements)
-------------------------------------

UNLOCK SYSTEM:
- Beat bosses to unlock new card types
- Discover biases to learn their counters permanently
- Collect "Insights" (currency) for meta upgrades

SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT (Character classes):
- RATIONALIST: Starts with logic cards, weak evidence
- EMPIRICIST: Starts with evidence, weak logic
- PRAGMATIST: Balanced, cards get stronger if "useful"
- SKEPTIC: Starts with questions, must build everything
- ABSURDIST: Random starting deck, embraces chaos


UNIQUE MECHANICS
----------------

1. COHERENCE (Health)
   - Your arguments must not contradict
   - Playing opposing cards damages YOU
   - Example: "Absolute truth exists" + "All truth is relative" = 10 self-damage
   - Strategic: Sometimes worth the self-damage for power

2. ARGUMENT CHAINS
   - Cards can link (If-Then, And, Therefore)
   - Longer chains = exponential power
   - But chains can be "broken" by biases
   - Risk/reward: 5-card chain vs safe 2-card plays

3. THE SYNTHESIS SYSTEM
   - Thesis card + Antithesis card = Synthesis
   - Synthesis is stronger than either alone
   - "Free will" + "Determinism" = "Compatibilism" (new card!)
   - Encourages collecting opposing ideas

4. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE MODE
   - Optionally argue FOR the bias
   - Extremely hard but massive rewards
   - Forces you to understand opposing views


WHY THIS FITS VERYGOODMELON.FUN
-------------------------------

PHILOSOPHICAL DEPTH:
- Actually teaches critical thinking
- Names and explains real mental models
- Players learn while playing

REDUCES ANXIETY:
- Understanding biases = less self-judgment
- Building arguments = sense of control
- No time pressure (turn-based)

UNIQUE TWIST:
- Not just "play cards, deal damage"
- Arguments must be coherent
- Teaches real logic patterns

REPLAYABILITY:
- Different schools of thought
- Procedural bias combinations
- Multiple paths to enlightenment


VISUAL STYLE
------------
- Paper-craft aesthetic (like thoughts on paper)
- Hand-drawn philosophical diagrams
- Floating in abstract "thought-space"
- Cards look like index cards with handwriting
- Biases appear as distorted, shifting shapes


MINIMUM VIABLE VERSION
----------------------

For initial release:
- 1 floor (5 biases + 1 boss)
- 20 starter cards
- 5 relics
- 1 school of thought
- Tutorial on basic logic patterns

Can expand to:
- 3 floors, 15+ biases, 60+ cards
- 4 schools of thought
- Daily challenges
- Multiplayer debate mode


SUMMARY
-------
Mind Architect is a roguelike deckbuilder where your deck is your mind,
your cards are ways of thinking, and your enemies are the biases that
distort clear thought. By playing it, players actually get better at
critical thinking while enjoying deep strategic gameplay.

"Build your mind. Defeat your biases. Think your way to enlightenment."
